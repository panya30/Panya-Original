## Key Decisions Made

1. **Brain + Skills together** - Not just memory, but procedures too
2. **Identity layer unique** - Our differentiator from competitors
3. **Knowledge transfer vision** - Sell/share skills in future
4. **Local-first** - Sovereignty over convenience
5. **Claude Skills compatible** - Use SKILL.md format

## Architecture Summary

```
Layer 4: IDENTITY    │ Robin's personality, relationship
Layer 3: BRAIN       │ Knowledge graph, memories, temporal
Layer 2: SKILLS      │ Procedures, workflows (Claude Skills format)
Layer 1: TOOLS       │ MCP connections
```

## Next Up

1. Start implementing Phase 1 components
2. Set up Oracle v2 for Panya (database schema)
3. Build file watcher prototype
